;IMPORTANT YOU USE THE VERSION OF THE MODULE/BOARD YOU ARE COMPILING FOR POSSIBLE VALUES...
;V400 = Original board (marked DIYBMS v4 on silkscreen) - has 8 large resistors (marked 2R20) and likely handsoldered using 0805 sized parts
;                  [4.0 boards do have TP2 near the ATTINY841 chip]
;
;V410 = JLCPCB built board (marked DIYBMS v4 on silkscreen) - has 8 large resistors (marked 2R00) and machine soldered using 0603 sized parts
;                  [4.1 boards do not have TP2 near the ATTINY841 chip]
;
;V420 = JLCPCB built board (marked DIYBMS v4.2 on silkscreen) - has 20 small resistors (marked 6R20) and machine soldered using 0603 sized parts (R20 is in middle of resistor array)
;
;V420_SWAPR19R20 = JLCPCB built board (marked DIYBMS v4.2 on silkscreen) - has 20 small resistors (marked 6R20) and machine soldered using 0603 sized parts
;                  [you have manually resoldered R19 and R20 to swap the positions on PCB to move the thermistor inside the resistor array]
;
;V421 = JLCPCB built board (marked DIYBMS v4.21 on silkscreen) - has 20 small resistors (marked 6R20) and machine soldered using 0603 sized parts (R19 is in middle of resistor array)
;
;V430 = JLCPCB built board (marked DIYBMS v4.3 on silkscreen) - has 20 small resistors (marked 6R20) and machine soldered using 0603 sized parts (R19 is in middle of resistor array)
;                  [Blue LED removed, resetable fuse fitted]
;** DO NOT FLASH V430 TO AN OLDER BOARD - THE ATTINY WILL BECOME UNUSABLE **
